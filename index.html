    <h2>1. Recent CSS Feature: New viewport Units</h2>
    <p>
      It is very important to take into account the size of the display when
      developign a web page. The <em><b>Viewport</b></em> units enable the developer
      to ensure that the web page takes into account the size of the client's display
      as well as an existing toolbar.
    </p>
    <a href="https://positivethinking.tech/insights/the-10-new-css-features-in-2023/"><img
        src="images/Viewport-units-new.png" alt="New Viewport Units" class="center"></a>

    <ul>
      <li><b><u>BLUE Arrow:</u></b> Indicates the <b>height</b> of the page. Does not take into account the toolbar</li>
      <li><b><u>RED Arrow:</u></b> Indicates the <b>height</b> visible on the screen due to the toolbar also taking up
        space</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This issue can be dealt with using the <em>new</em> <i>Viewport Units</i> listed below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><u>Small viewport (svh/svw) :</u></b> takes the address bar and the toolbar into consideration.</li>
      <li><b><u>Large viewport (lvh/lvw) :</u></b> doesn't take the address bar and the toolbar into consideration.</li>
      <li><b><u>Dynamic viewport (dvh/dvw) :</u></b> adapts its value when the toolbars are visible or/and when they are
        not.</li>
    </ul>

    <em>*Important note: These units <b>do not</b> take into account the scroll bar. Therefore the used
      is situational and another method may be more suitable depending on the circumstances.</em>

    <h2>2. My Favorite CSS Feature: Implementing 3D Interactive Models</h2>
    <p>
      CSS gives the flexibility to add interactive content and images that provide the user
      with interactive controls via keyboard, or by dragging using the mouse. The model below is
      an example powered by <a href="https://modelviewer.dev/"><code>model-viewer</code></a>. Ability
      to use these models would offer a better user experience and endless opportunities for
      creating interactive content.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How AI is impacting the Web Design & Development</h2>
    <p>
      The automation and suggestions provided by AI can definitely be an asset when
      it comes to web design and development. The use of AI is overall positive, as it provides
      suggestions and is capable of recognizing patterns and analyzing on its own to provide
      results within seconds. It is however, very important not to rely on AI and always check due to the possibility
      of mistakes. AI can be prone to mistakes and should be used as a tool to help but not
      be relied on to get the entire work complete.
